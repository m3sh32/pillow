## Documentation

The docs are built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/).  Docstrings are injected into the Markdown source files with [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io).

Serve the generated docs locally with `mkdocs serve`.  A GitHub action publishes the docs to GitHub Pages on pushes to the main branch.
